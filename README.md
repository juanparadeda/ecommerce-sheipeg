# eCommerce project: Sheipeg Photography Store

This is a project for the React.js training I'm taking in Coderhouse : https://www.coderhouse.com/
The purpose of the training is to apply the previously acquired knowledge of HTML, CSS, SASS, Vanilla JS, plus the concepts learned in this React.js training, to build the Front End of an eCommerce store. 

## Required dependancies to be installed

You will need node.js installed locally to be able to install further dependancies. You can download node.js for your OS from this website: https://nodejs.org/en/

Then you will need to create a react app by running `npx create-react-app your-directory`. your-directory is the directory (or folder, if you speak Windows, lol) where your react app will run

To get your app to run locally and get a preview of the app in your browser, first place yourself in your app directory `cd your-directory` and then run `npm start`

After a while, a browser window should open up, on the url `http://localhost:3000`, showing the react logo rotating smoothly. For network access to your local app, other hosts in the network might browse to `http://192.168.0.137:3000`

This project uses react-router-dom for link routing. You need to install this dependancy by typing `npm install react-router-dom`

This project uses Material UI component library. To install this library, type `npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled`. You will also need one additional package.json dependancy for the icons: `npm install @mui/icons-material`.

This project uses react-hook-form for data input validation. To install this dependancy with npm: `npm install react-hook-form`.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
